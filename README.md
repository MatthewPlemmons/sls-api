# AWS Serverless Test
Simple project testing out AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway and the Serverless framework.  Use url endpoints to perform basic operations on a DynamoDB table.


## Setup
Install the Serverless framework.
```bash
npm install serverless -g
```

## Deploy

Run this command to package up the service and deploy it to AWS servers.

```bash
serverless deploy
```

## Usage

Use the curl command to access the database operations at each endpoint.  The following database operations are available.

### Create
Save a new database item.  Requires `name` and `country` values.
```bash
# Replace `xyz` with the unique id generated by Serverless.
curl -X POST https://xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api --data '{ "name": "Matthew", "country": "USA" }'
```
### List
Return a list of all current database items.
```bash
curl https://xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api
```

### Get
Fetches a single item from the database.
```bash
# Replace the <id> part with a real id from your todos table
curl https://xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/<id>
```

### Delete
Erases an item from the database.
```bash
# Replace the <id> part with a real id from your todos table
curl -X DELETE https://xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/<id>
```
